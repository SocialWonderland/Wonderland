Under no means are you able to redistribute the code created by our team. Some code is okay to use, (Open Source Code that we use for sockets, servers etc.) but Wonderland's Code is property of the Wonderland Team.

Eventually; Wonderlands code will become open-sourced for use, but not our specific branding and such. This version will be release in a while, a year or two possibly.
